# üè° House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## üìå Project Description

This project aims to predict the prices of residential properties using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a real-world dataset of house sales, it uses various regression algorithms to build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on multiple influential features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.

The project involves extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and interpretation to create a robust price prediction engine. The ultimate goal is to support home buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in making data-driven decisions.

## üìä Metrics and Measures

| Metric               | Description                                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**     | Measures average magnitude of errors in predictions (in same units as target). |
| **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**     | Penalizes larger errors more due to squaring ‚Äì useful for model sensitivity.     |
| **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**| More interpretable version of MSE (in original units).                          |
| **R¬≤ Score (R-Squared)**         | Indicates how well features explain target variability (closer to 1 is better).  |

## üìà Visualizations and Their Purposes

### 1. **Correlation Heatmap**
- **Purpose:** To identify multicollinearity among features and their correlation with the target (`Price`).
- **Insights:** Features like `sqft_living`, `grade`, and `bathrooms` had strong correlation with price.

### 2. **Histogram of House Prices**
- **Purpose:** Visualize the distribution of house prices to identify skewness and outliers.
- **Insights:** Prices are right-skewed, with some extremely high-value properties.

### 3. **Boxplots for Categorical Features vs Price**
- **Example:** `grade` vs `price`, `bedrooms` vs `price`
- **Purpose:** To understand how categorical levels influence price and spot anomalies.
- **Insights:** Higher `grade` is positively associated with higher price.

### 4. **Scatter Plots**
- **Example:** `sqft_living` vs `price`, `bathrooms` vs `price`
- **Purpose:** To examine linear relationships and detect patterns or clusters.
- **Insights:** `sqft_living` shows a clear positive trend with price.

### 5. **Pairplots**
- **Purpose:** To explore multiple relationships at once and spot key influencers.
- **Insights:** Supports correlation analysis; confirms `sqft_living`, `grade`, and `bathrooms` are important.

### 6. **Distribution Plot of Residuals**
- **Purpose:** To check if residuals (errors) from predictions are normally distributed.
- **Insights:** Residuals are mostly centered around zero, indicating a good model fit.

## üß† Key Findings

- **Highly Influential Features:** `sqft_living`, `bathrooms`, `grade`, `view`, and `waterfront`.
- **Best Model:** Ridge Regression achieved the best R¬≤ score on the test set after hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Performance:** Most models performed well, but Ridge offered a balance between underfitting and overfitting.
- **Skewness Handling:** Log transformation of the target variable improved model accuracy.
